							It was a favored residence of Scottish monarchs, including Mary,
							Queen of Scots. The Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297 saw William
							Wallace's victory against English forces during the Wars of
							Scottish Independence. The Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, led by
							Robert the Bruce, secured Scotland's independence from England.

							Before the construction of the more well-known Inveraray Castle,
							the home of Clan Campbell would be <strong>Innis Chonnel</strong>,
							a rocky island in the middle of Loch Awe. Becoming their
							stronghold by the year 1308, the castle would be passed to the
							family by the MacDougalls â€“ the original owners and likely
							builders of the structure. This transfer of power would occur
							after the MacDougalls opposed the rule of the new king, Robert the
							Bruce, holding the island against him in 1308. Eventually, the
							MacDougalls would be defeated, with the castle and the Lordship of
							Loch Awe given to the Campbells, as the free barony was confirmed
							to Sir Colin Campbell in 1315. The Campbells would then use the
							castle as their base for over a century, refusing to move until
							the time of Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, in the late 15th
							century. The Duke would make Inveraray his primary residence,
							constructing a new clan seat for one of the largest clans in the
							country. Meanwhile, the condition of Innis Chonnel would start to
							deteriorate, as it was used by the Campbells as a place of
							confinement for political and criminal prisoners. Sadly, the
							castle would continue to deteriorate over the subsequent years,
							eventually becoming overgrown and unrecognisable from its original
							state, it remains under the ownership of the Campbells of Argyll
							and is sadly not open to the public because of its poor condition,
							however, anyone looking for a closer look is welcome to hire a
							kayak and explore the surrounding waters on their own. <br />

							Leven in Scotland, holds a significant place in history. Dating
							back to the 14th century, it served as a royal residence and

							forced to abdicate the throne. Her escape from Lochleven Castle in
							1568 marked a pivotal moment in Scottish history. The castle's
							ruins today offer a glimpse into its former grandeur, including
							the tower, walls, and courtyard. Accessible by boat, Lochleven
