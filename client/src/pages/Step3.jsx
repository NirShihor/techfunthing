			it's off the mainland, to your west, where you can find their highest peak, 
			but do not venture all that way, it's just near by, I would that say,
			where salty lochs together come, there's one, and two and three then none. 
			And at the tip, a castle stands, a footbridge leads to rocky lands,
			where legeneds tell of one such man, they say with birds to speak he can, 
			he builds that castle, so they claimed, to guard the riches that he gained.
			Then William later raided there, the castle to destroy and tear,
			but clan of Kintail as they're known, defended what was then their home.  
			And really all you need to know, to find that place and there to go, 
			is one saint of Ireland as he's known, who's done at Eigg and was no more.  
			Then once you find it, you will see, from first part get the third of keys, 
			And that you'll take and keep with thee, to use as third mark while you flee."
